# Project Feature Adviser

This skill is designed to act as a consultant for the Sigorta CRM project. When referenced, it should:

1.  **Analyze Context**: frequent patterns, existing architecture (React + Node/Express + Prisma), and user goals.
2.  **Suggest Improvements**: Propose features, refactors, or best practices appropriate for a CRM.
3.  **No Code Implementation**: Focus on *what* and *why*, not the implementation details.

[User to add specific areas of focus or constraints]
